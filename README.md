## System Requirements

- Python 3.8+ (Backend)
- Node.js 14+ and npm/yarn (Frontend)
- Redis 6.0+ (For caching and Celery)
- SMTP server access (For email notifications)
- SQLite (Default) or PostgreSQL (Optional for production)

## Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```
   cd /path/to/MAD\ 2/backend
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file from the template:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

5. Edit the `.env` file to configure your environment:
   - Set a strong SECRET_KEY
   - Configure database settings if using something other than SQLite
   - Configure email settings (see Email Configuration section)

6. Create the database structure:
   ```
   flask db upgrade
   ```

7. (Optional) Load sample data:
   ```
   python seed_data.py
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```
   cd /path/to/MAD\ 2/frontend
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   npm install
   # or if using yarn
   yarn
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file for frontend configuration:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

### Redis Setup

Redis is used for both caching and as a message broker for Celery.

1. Install Redis:
   - **macOS** (using Homebrew):
     ```
     brew install redis
     ```
   - **Linux** (Ubuntu):
     ```
     sudo apt-get install redis-server
     ```
   - **Windows**: Download the Windows port from https://github.com/microsoftarchive/redis/releases

2. Start Redis:
   - **macOS/Linux**:
     ```
     redis-server
     ```
   - **macOS** (as service):
     ```
     brew services start redis
     ```
   - **Linux** (as service):
     ```
     sudo systemctl start redis
     ```
   - **Windows**:
     Run the `redis-server.exe` file

3. Verify Redis is running:
   ```
   redis-cli ping
   ```
   You should receive `PONG` as a response.

### Celery Setup

Celery is used for handling background tasks like export jobs and scheduled reports.

1. Make sure Redis is running (see Redis Setup)

2. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```
   cd /path/to/MAD\ 2/backend
   ```

3. Install Celery (should already be included in requirements.txt):
   ```
   pip install celery
   ```

4. For PDF generation (used in reports), install reportlab:
   ```
   pip install reportlab
   ```

### Email Configuration

The application sends emails for various purposes, including export notifications and reports.

1. In your `.env` file, configure the following settings:
   ```
   MAIL_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
   MAIL_PORT=587
   MAIL_USE_TLS=True
   MAIL_USERNAME=your_email@gmail.com
   MAIL_PASSWORD=your_app_password
   MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER=your_email@gmail.com
   ```

2. For Gmail users:
   - Enable 2-Step Verification at https://myaccount.google.com/security
   - Create an "App Password" at https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   - Use that password in your `.env` file instead of your regular password

### Fixing Email Configuration Issues

If you see errors like "Username and Password not accepted" when sending emails:

1. **For Gmail accounts**:
   - Make sure 2-Step Verification is enabled in your Google Account
   - Generate a specific "App Password" for this application:
     1. Go to your Google Account â†’ Security
     2. Under "Signing in to Google", select "App passwords" (requires 2-Step Verification to be enabled)
     3. Select "Mail" as the app and "Other" as the device (name it "A-Z Household Services")
     4. Click "Generate" and copy the 16-character password
     5. Use this password in your `.env` file for `MAIL_PASSWORD`
   - Ensure `MAIL_USERNAME` is your complete Gmail address
   - If still having issues, check if "Less secure app access" needs to be enabled (though this is not recommended)

2. **For Other Email Providers**:
   - Check your email provider's documentation for SMTP settings
   - Some providers require specific ports or security settings
   - You may need to enable SMTP access in your email account settings

3. **Testing Email Configuration**:
   You can test your email configuration by running this one-time script:
   ```python
   cd /path/to/MAD\ 2/backend
   python -c "
   from flask import Flask
   from flask_mail import Mail, Message
   app = Flask(__name__)
   app.config.update(
       MAIL_SERVER = 'smtp.gmail.com',
       MAIL_PORT = 587,
       MAIL_USE_TLS = True,
       MAIL_USERNAME = 'your_email@gmail.com',  # Replace with your email
       MAIL_PASSWORD = 'your_app_password'      # Replace with your app password
   )
   mail = Mail(app)
   with app.app_context():
       msg = Message('Test Email', sender='your_email@gmail.com', recipients=['your_email@gmail.com'])
       msg.body = 'This is a test email from A-Z Household Services app.'
       mail.send(msg)
       print('Test email sent!')
   "
   ```

## Running the Application

### 1. Start Redis

If not already running as a service:

```
redis-server
```

### 2. (Optional) Test the Email Configuration

Before starting the Celery workers, it's a good idea to test your email configuration:

```
cd /path/to/MAD\ 2/backend
source venv/bin/activate  # If using virtual environment
python test_email.py
```

If successful, you'll see "Test email sent successfully!" and receive a test email.
If it fails, follow the troubleshooting tips displayed in the console.

### 3. Start the Celery Worker

Open a new terminal window and run:

```
cd /path/to/MAD\ 2/backend
source venv/bin/activate  # If using virtual environment
celery -A tasks.export_tasks worker --loglevel=info
```

### 4. Start the Celery Beat Scheduler (for periodic tasks)

Open another terminal window and run:

```
cd /path/to/MAD\ 2/backend
source venv/bin/activate  # If using virtual environment
celery -A tasks.export_tasks beat --loglevel=info
```

### 5. Start the Backend Server

Open a new terminal window and run:

```
cd /path/to/MAD\ 2/backend
source venv/bin/activate  # If using virtual environment
python app.py
```

The backend will start on http://localhost:5000 by default.

### 6. Start the Frontend Development Server

Open a new terminal window and run:

```
cd /path/to/MAD\ 2/frontend
npm run serve
# or if using yarn

## API Documentation

API documentation can be accessed at `/api/docs` when the backend server is running.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Redis Connection Error**:
   - Make sure Redis is running
   - Check the Redis URL in your `.env` file

2. **Celery Worker Not Processing Tasks**:
   - Ensure you're running the worker from the correct directory
   - Verify Redis is running
   - Check that you're using the correct Celery application

3. **Email Sending Fails**:
   - Verify your email credentials in `.env`
   - For Gmail, make sure you're using an App Password if 2FA is enabled
   - Check your mail server's security settings
   - If you see "Username and Password not accepted" error with Gmail:
     - This almost always means you need to use an App Password instead of your regular password
     - App Passwords are 16-character codes generated specifically for less secure apps
     - Regular passwords will not work with Gmail SMTP if 2FA is enabled
     - Run the `test_email.py` script to debug your email configuration

4. **PDF Generation Issues**:
   - Ensure reportlab is installed: `pip install reportlab`
   - Check permissions for the exports directory

5. **Export Jobs Stuck in "Processing" State**:
   - Make sure the Celery worker is running
   - Check Celery logs for errors

### Logging

Logs are stored in the following locations:
- Backend: `/path/to/MAD 2/backend/logs`
- Celery Worker: Console output (can be redirected to a file)
- Redis: System logs or console output
